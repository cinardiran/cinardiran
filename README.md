## \# 👋 About Me

## 

## I study Computer Science at USW and have a passion for programming. I am from Cyprus, and as a child I always wanted to travel the world, so studying abroad has been a unique experience for me. Programming fascinates me because of how powerful it is and how much can be achieved with it in the future.

## \## 📂 Projects

## 

## I have completed multiple small coding exercises as part of my coursework to get familiar with the C++ language. These include:

## 

## \* Mathematical calculations

## \* Percentage calculations using user input

## \* Loops and if statements

## \* Reading data from files

## \* Rounding values and other basic programming concepts

## 

## Although these were for coursework in the near future, I would like to work on personal projects based on my own ideas.

## \## 🎯 Hobbies

## 

## In my free time, I enjoy staying active by doing sports. I also like reading fantasy books as it helps me realise that even though the worlds in books seem dreamlike, our own world is just as interesting and worth exploring. I also enjoy fixing things, as it is rewarding to see something work after spending a considerable amount of time and also understanding how its parts connect together while it works is also another reason I like it, which I found that it is similar to programming.
